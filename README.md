# Ph.D. Qualifying Exam: Shifting Sands - Temporal Context Shift in Words

This repository is for my Ph.D. qualifying exam report, titled “Shifting Sands: Temporal Context Shift in Words.”. This work presents a comprehensive literature review on the evolving meanings of words over time, exploring how shifts in linguistic context reflect deeper social, technological, and cultural changes.

### Focused Papers:
1. Kulkarni, V., Al-Rfou, R., Perozzi, B., & Skiena, S. (2014). Statistically Significant Detection of Linguistic Change\
   This paper introduces methods for detecting statistically significant changes in word usage over time, using time series analysis of word embeddings.

3. Hamilton, W. L., Leskovec, J., & Jurafsky, D. (2016). Diachronic Word Embeddings Reveal Statistical Laws of Semantic Change\
This research outlines how word embeddings can be used to model and understand the processes underlying semantic change, proposing two statistical laws governing these shifts.
